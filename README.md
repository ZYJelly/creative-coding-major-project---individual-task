At the beginning of the animation, I introduced to the user how to interact with it. The instructional text will disappear automatically after 3 seconds. Users can click the mouse to start the fireworks display, and a timer causes the fireworks to bloom at intervals. A second click stops them. While the fireworks are blooming, users can press the spacebar, and the fireworks will gradually turn red over five seconds due to the timer. Pressing the spacebar again will cause the fireworks to gradually revert to their original color. The inspiration comes from the Chinese New Year, where the red fireworks and the snowflakes in the background together create a festive and joyous New Year atmosphere.
